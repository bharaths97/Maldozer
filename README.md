# Maldozer
In order to add dataser, Please create a folder "Resources" in the same folder as the code and inside that folder create another folder "APK files". Place your APK files by class inside this newly created folder.

I have used Benign, Adware, Riskware, Banking and SMS as my APK classes. In case you are adding more or less, Go into the MALDOZER_CONSTANTS.py file and edit the constants variable. 

For execution, Just execute Maldozer_APK_Analysis_Main.py file
